      <h1>About Hue U Xchange</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Where soul meets style. Where darkness turns into light.</p>

      <p><strong>Hue U Xchange</strong> is not just an online shop. It is a sacred portal — a transformational gateway designed for the Shining Light Army, a community of Lightbearers walking their curing process.</p>

      <p>Each offering is more than a product — it’s a piece of energy, a symbol of commitment, and a companion on the road to self-redemption. Whether you're wrapping yourself in a <em>Divine Hoodie</em> or tuning into the frequencies of the <em>Music EP</em>, you are participating in an act of spiritual exchange, not consumption.</p>

      <p>The vision comes from the story of <strong>Donny D</strong> — a seeker who stumbled into exile, wrestled his own shadows, and emerged bearing light. Just like Donny, every visitor to Hue U is invited to begin their own curing process.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>To provide symbols, tools, and reminders that support the journey from chaos to clarity, from shadow to light, from being lost to becoming a Lightbearer.</p>

      <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Energy Offerings:</strong> Ritual kits, aura oils, and access codes</li>
        <li><strong>Wearables:</strong> Divine Hoodies and other symbolic apparel</li>
        <li><strong>Sonic Guidance:</strong> Music and sound rituals from the Lightbearer archives</li>
        <li><strong>Community Vibes:</strong> A place of initiation, not just transaction</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Thank you for showing up with your hue. You are welcome here.</p>
